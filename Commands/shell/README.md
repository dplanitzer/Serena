# The Shell

Serena OS comes with a powerful shell that allows you to run applications, work with files, directories, expressions and to write and execute scripts. Contrary to traditional shell languages, the Serena shell language is a fully formally defined language which features expressions, a formally defined type system, scoping, immutable and mutable variables, flow control constructs and a large array of builtin commands.

See the chapters below for more information about various shell topics.
