# Line Editor

You enter shell commands in the shell's line editor. The line editor allows you to enter, edit and recall previously entered commands. Please note that the line editor is currently limited to override/replace mode.

To enter a command, type it in the currently active line and hit the return/enter key. This triggers the execution of the command and it adds the command to the command history. A previously entered command may be recalled by pressing the cursor-up key. You can scroll through all commands in the command history by pressing the cursor-up and cursor-down keys.

Some simple editing functions are supported. Backspace moves the cursor one column to the left, the cursor-left and cursor-right keys move the cursor left and right respectively. Ctrl-a moves the cursor to the beginning of the line and Ctrl-e moves the cursor to the end of the line. Finally, pressing Ctrl-l clears the screen.
