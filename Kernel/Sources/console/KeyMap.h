// A key map maps a USB key code to a single character or a string. The mapping
// can take the current state of the modifier flags into account.
//
// A key map consists of a table of 'key mapping ranges'. Each key mapping range
// starts at a certain USB key code and covers all USB key codes up to an upper
// boundary key code. Each key code range consists of a table of 'key code traps'.
//
// There are different types of key code traps: some map a USB key code to a
// single character depending on the current state of the modifier flags and
// others map a single USB key code to a string independent of the current state
// of the modifier flags.
//
// Additional key code trap types may be introduced in the future.
//
// Each key code trap has an associated action. Currently the only supported
// action is the default action which is 'marking'.
//
// The key code trap actions are:
// *) Marking: the associated character is returned
// *) Combining: the associated character is added to a buffer. This action
//               continues until the user presses a key that is associated with
//               a marking character. The marking character is still appended to
//               the buffer and the buffer is drained and its contents returned.
//
// The combining action gives the same functionality that dead keys gave in the
// traditional model except that they make it easier to define dead keys since
// dead keys naturally map to decomposed Unicode character strings.


// A positive byte offset to the desired data. The offset is relative to the
// first byte of the KeyMap data structure.

// 'traps' points to an array of 4 bytes per key:
// *) byte #0: unmodified, byte#1: shift, byte #2: option, byte #3: shift + option
// *) control key clears bits 7, 6 & 5 and is applied after applying the shift
//    and alt keys to select the character
// *) left and right hand modifier keys produce the same character
// *) a \0 character in one of the shifted positions produces the base character
// *) a \0 character is not allowed in the base position
// *) all keys are marking
