// Note that a process channel maintains a weak link to its process. The reason
// for this is that we want to ensure that if process X pens a channel to process
// Y, that X is not going to keep process Y alive simply by keeping the channel
// open for an arbitrary amount of time. The lifetime of process Y is independent
// of X. Thus process Y may go away at any time even if process X has a channel
// open to Y. Process X will simply receive a suitable error (ESRCH) when it
// tries to execute a function on the channel and process Y no longer exists.
