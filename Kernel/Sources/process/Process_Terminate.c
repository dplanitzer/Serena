{
    // Notes on terminating a process:
    //
    // All VPs belonging to a process are executing call-as-user invocations. The
    // first step of terminating a process is to abort all these invocations. This
    // is done by terminating all dispatch queues that belong to the process first.
    //
    // What does aborting a call-as-user invocation mean?
    // 1) If a VP is currently executing in user space then the user space
    //    invocation is aborted and the VP returns back to the dispatch queue
    //    main loop.
    // 2) If a VP is currently executing inside a system call then this system
    //    call has to first complete and we then abort the user space invocation
    //    that led to the system call when the system call would normally return
    //    to user space. So the return to user space is redirected to a piece of
    //    code that aborts the user space invocation. The VP then returns back
    //    to the dispatch queue main loop.
    // 3) A VP may be in waiting state because it executed a system call that
    //    invoked a blocking function. This wait will be interrupted/aborted as
    //    a side-effect of aborting the call-as-user invocation. Additionally all
    //    further abortable waits that the VP wants to take are immediately aborted
    //    until the VP has left the system call. This auto-abort does not apply
    //    to non-abortable waits like Lock_Lock.
    // 
    // Terminating a dispatch queue means that all queued up work items and timers
    // are flushed from the queue and that the queue relinquishes all its VPs. The
    // queue also stops accepting new work.
    //
    // A word on process termination and system calls:
    //
    // A system call MUST complete its run before the process data structures can
    // be freed. This is required because a system call manipulates kernel state
    // and we must ensure that every state manipulation is properly finalized
    // before we continue.
    // Note also that a system call that takes a kernel lock must eventually drop
    // this lock (it can not endlessly hold it) and it is expected to drop the
    // lock ASAP (it can not take unnecessarily long to release the lock). That's
    // why it is fine that Lock_Lock() is not interruptable even in the face of
    // the ability to terminate a process voluntarily/involuntarily.
    // The top-level system call handler checks whether a process is terminating
    // and it aborts the user space invocation that led to the system call. This
    // is the only required process termination check in a system call. All other
    // checks are voluntarily.
    // That said, every wait also does a check for process termination and the
    // wait immediately returns with an EINTR if the process is in the process of
    // being terminated. The only exception to this is the wait that Lock_Lock()
    // does since this kind of lock is a kernel lock that is used to preserve the
    // integrity of kernel data structures.

    // Notes on terminating a process tree:
    //
    // If a process terminates voluntarily or involuntarily then it'll by default
    // also terminate all its children, grand-children, etc processes. Every
    // process in the tree first terminates its children before it completes its
    // own termination. Doing it this way ensures that a parent process won't
    // (magically) disappear before all its children have terminated.

    // invocations.
