// A shared-exclusive lock offers two modes of locking:
// - shared: multiple VPs may lock the lock in shared mode at the same time.
// - exclusive: at most one VP may hold the lock in exclusive mode.
// If a VP wants to take a shared-mode lock and the lock is currently in shared
// mode or unlocked then the lock request will be granted immediately. If however
// the lock is currently in exclusive mode then the lock requestor will have to
// wait until the lock owner unlocks the lock.
// If a VP wants to take an exclusive-mode lock and the lock is currently unlocked
// then the request will be granted immediately. If however the lock is currently
// in shared or exclusive mode then the requestor will have to wait until the
// single exclusive owner has unlocked the lock or all shared-mode lock owners
// have unlocked the lock.
//
// Note that a shared-exclusive lock is always interruptable. This is different
// from simple kernel-mode locks which are not interruptible.
//
// Note that a single shared or exclusive lock owner is allowed to take the lock
// multiple times (aka recursive locking). However the lock does not currently
// track the identity of shared-mode lock owners. So it's important to follow
// the locking protocol exactly to avoid problems.
