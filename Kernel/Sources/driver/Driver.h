// A driver object manages a device. A device is a piece of hardware while a
// driver is the software that manages the hardware.
//
// Drivers are organized in a driver hierarchy - also known as a driver tree.
// The root of the driver hierarchy is the 'platform controller'. This is a
// special kind of driver that knows how to detect all the various hardware
// components on a motherboard and how to create drivers for them. Many of the
// drivers that the platform controller creates are 'bus controllers'.
//
// A bus controller is a kind of driver that manages a physical or a virtual bus.
// It is responsible for detecting hardware that is connected to the bus and it
// kicks off the creation of bus client drivers that then manage the hardware
// that is connected to a bus.
//
// Every driver has a parent driver and it may have children drivers. The parent
// driver is usually the bus controller that manages the driver. However the
// parent driver may be an intermediate driver that sits between you and the bus
// controller. Your driver should use the services of the parent driver to issue
// commands to the bus. 
//
//
// -- The Driver Lifecycle --
//
// Every driver instance goes through a lifecycle. The various lifecycle stages
// are:
// - created: driver was just created
// - active: entered by calling Driver_Start()
// - stopping: entered by calling Driver_Stop() with a stop reason
// - stopped: entered by calling Driver_WaitForStopped()
// - ready for destroy: the driver may be destroyed once Driver_WaitForStopped()
//                      returns
//
// A driver must be started by calling Driver_Start() before any other driver
// function is called. It is however possible to release a driver reference by
// calling Object_Release() even before Driver_Start() is called.
//
// The Driver_Start() function transitions the driver lifecycle state to active
// and it invokes the onStart() method. A driver subclass is expected to override
// onStart() to publish the driver to the driver catalog by calling
// Driver_Publish(). Additionally the driver subclass can do device specific
// initialization work in onStart(). A driver will only enter active state if
// the onStart() override returns with EOK.
//
// Once a driver has been started, driver channels may be created by calling
// Driver_Open() and a driver channel should be closed by calling
// IOChannel_Close() on the channel. IOChannel_Close() in turn invokes
// Driver_Close().
//
// A driver may be voluntarily terminated by calling Driver_Stop() with the.
// kDriverStop_Shutdown parameter. This indicates to the driver system that the
// driver wants to stop in a voluntarily and orderly fashion. If the driver is
// a bus controller (driver) then this stop will be automatically propagated to
// all the child drivers and the child drivers will be able to use I/O services
// of the bus driver to orderly shut down themselves.
//
// For example, a SCSI bus driver that stops will stop all of its bus clients by
// calling Driver_Stop() on them with the same reason that was passed to the
// SCSI bus driver. If the reason is kDriverStop_Shutdown then bus clients like
// a SCSI disk driver will be able to use the I/O services of the SCSI bus driver
// to park the head of the disk.
//
// If however the stop reason is kDriverStop_Abort or kDriverStop_HardwareLoss
// then the bus client drivers would not be allowed to use the SCSI bus driver
// I/O services since either the SCSI bus driver is in an undetermined state or
// it is no longer able to access the SCSI hardware.
// 
// The next step after calling Driver_Stop() is to invoke Driver_WaitForStopped().
// A driver may deploy asynchronous services internally and the shutdown of those
// services is triggered by the Driver_Stop() call. However it can take a while
// for those services to complete their shutdown. This is why it is necessary to
// wait by calling Driver_WaitForStopped() before you release the driver instance
// by calling Object_Release(). Note that the wait-for-stopped function also
// waits until after all open I/O channels on the driver have been closed.
//
// A typical driver lifecycle looks like this:
//
// Driver_Create()
//   Driver_Start()
//     Driver_Open()
//       IOChannel_Read()
//       ...
//     Driver_Close()
//   Driver_Stop()
//   Driver_WaitForStopped()
// Object_Release()
//
// Note that an important purpose of I/O channels is to enable the driver system
// to track whether a driver is in active use.
//
//
// -- Drivers, Concurrency and Exclusivity --
//
// I/O channel provides important preconditions for what is discussed below:
// *) All operations on an I/O channel are executed serially
// *) At most one operation can be active on an I/O channel at any given time
// *) It guarantees that no operation is active when it calls Driver_Close()
// *) It guarantees that as soon as Driver_Close() starts executing and at any
//    time after it returns, no new I/O operations will be issued to the driver
//
// The driver operations start(), open(), close() and terminate() are exclusive
// to each other in terms concurrency. This means that only one of those
// operations will execute at any given time. This ensures for example that
// start() has completed before open() can begin execution and that open() has
// completed before close() can begin execution.
//
// The fact that all driver I/O operations (read, write, ioctl) require that the
// caller passes in a I/O channel ensures that none of these operations can be
// executed before open() has completed and returned a valid I/O channel.
//
// The fact that I/O channel guarantees that all active I/O operations on the
// channel have completed before it invokes close() on the driver ensures that
// close() can assume that no I/O operations can be active that are related to
// the channel that is passed to close(). Thus it is not necessary for close()
// to take the same lock that is used to protect the integrity of the I/O
// operations.
//
// Note that onStart(), onStop(), onOpen() and onClose() are invoked while the
// driver is holding the driver state management lock. This should not be of
// much relevance to a driver subclass since a driver subclass has no need to
// acquire its I/O operations lock from these overrides. See the previous
// paragraph for an explanation of why this is the case.
//
// A driver subclass is expected to guarantee that its read, write and ioctl
// operations are properly synchronized with each other and that invoking these
// methods concurrently will not lead to inconsistent hardware nor software
// state.
//
// A driver can achieve this by eg protecting these methods with an I/O
// operation lock (mutex), by using a serial dispatch queue or by implementing
// its own specialized I/O operations queueing mechanism.
//
//
// -- The Driver Lifecycle and I/O Operations Locks --
//
// Every driver owns and manages two important locks.
//
// The first one is the lifecycle management lock. This lock is owned and
// managed by the Driver base class and subclasses do not need to worry about
// the details of this lock. This lock is used to protect the integrity of the
// driver state and it is used to ensure atomicity and exclusivity of the
// start(), stop(), open() and close() driver functions.
//
// The second lock is the I/O operations lock which is owned and managed by the
// Driver subclass. it is used to protect the integrity of the I/O related
// hardware and software state of the Driver subclass. It is also used to ensure
// atomicity and exclusivity of teh read(), write() and ioctl() functions.
//
// It is the responsibility of a Driver subclass writer to implement the I/O
// operations lock and that it is acquired and released at the appropriate
// times.
//
//
// -- The Children of a Driver --
//
// A driver may create and manage child drivers. Child drivers are attached to
// their parent drivers and the parent driver maintains a strong reference to
// its child driver(s). This strong reference keeps a child driver alive as long
// as it remains attached to its parent.
//
// The parent-child driver relationship can be used to properly represent
// relationships like a bus and the devices on the bus. The bus is represented
// by the parent driver and each device on the bus is represented by a child
// driver.
//
// Another use case for the parent-child driver relationship is that of a multi-
// function expansion board: an expansion board which features a sound chip and
// a CD-ROM driver can be represented by a parent driver that manages the overall
// card functionality plus a child driver for the sound chip and another child
// driver for the CD-ROM drive.
//
// A bus driver must explicitly configure the maximum number of children that it
// should manage. This number can be seen as the number of slots that are
// available on a physical bus. You configure this number by calling
// Driver_SetMaxChildCount() after you've created the bus driver instance and
// before you publish it to the driver catalog.
//
// A child driver may either receive a channel or a direct reference to its
// parent driver which it can then use to access the services that the parent
// driver provides. Both models are supported and the parent driver will stay
// alive as long as at least one channel is open or one child remains attached
// to it.
//
// A child driver is guaranteed that the reference to its parent driver will
// remain valid from the moment that its onStart() is invoked until the moment
// it returns from its onWaitForStopped() override.
//
//
// -- Parent - Child Driver Relationship and Starting/Stopping a Driver --
//
// A driver must be attached to a parent driver before it can be started to
// ensure that the driver will be able to access the services of its parent
// as soon as its onStart() method is called.
//
// A driver must be stopped before it can be detached from its parent driver to
// ensure that it continues to have access to the services that its parent driver
// provides until it has returned from its onWaitForStopped() override.
//
// The Driver_AttachChild() and Driver_DetachChild() methods implement and
// guarantee the semantics described in the previous paragraphs.
//
//
// -- What it Means for a Driver to be in Use --
//
// A driver is considered to be in use if:
// - at least one channel is open
// - at least one child is attached to it
// A driver that is in use may be stopped. However the driver isn't destroyed
// until after the last use of it is gone.
//
//
// -- Driver Relationships and Ownership --
//
// A parent driver owns its children and thus retains a child when it is added
// to the parent. A child driver should not retain its parent. It should only
// maintain a weak reference to its parent driver.
//
//
// -- Driver Categories --
//
// A driver conforms to a set of I/O categories. For many drivers it is sufficient
// to declare a single I/O category conformance. However a more complex driver
// that controls a piece of hardware that implements a number of different
// features will potentially declare one I/O category per feature. This is the
// reason why the Driver_Create() function takes an array of I/O categories. This
// array must be terminated with an IOCAT_END declaration. Note that the
// Driver_Create() function does not copy the I/O categories array. This array
// should be declared as a const static array. Use the IOCATS_DEF() macro to
// declare the I/O category array for your driver to get the correct declaration.
//
// Use the Driver_GetCategories() function to get a pointer to the read-only
// array of I/O categories the driver conforms to. This array is terminated by
// an IOCAT_END declaration.
//
// Use the Driver_HasCategory() function to check whether the driver conforms to
// a given I/O category.
//
// These functions can be used to easily and efficiently determine whether a
// driver controls hardware of a certain kind (eg whether it is a SCSI bus) and
// whether the hardware supports a certain kind of feature (eg whether a graphic
// card supports 2D and/or 3d hardware acceleration).
