// A driver object binds to and manages a device. A device is a piece of hardware
// while a driver is the software that manages the hardware.
//
// A driver may implement a synchronous or an asynchronous model. The driver
// model determines which kind of functionality the driver supports.
//
// A synchronous driver is a very simple kind of driver that is created and then
// stays alive until the system is shut down. It is not able to detect loss of
// hardware and it can not be terminated. A synchronous driver executes all
// driver functions immediately and in the same execution context as the calling
// function.
//
// An asynchronous driver is created and then stays alive until it is terminated.
// The termination function may be called at any time and it blocks the caller
// until the driver has finished shutting down. Terminating a driver relinquishes
// control of the hardware that the driver managed. Once Driver_Terminate()
// returns, a new driver instance of the same of a different class may be created
// and bound to the hardware.
// An asynchronous driver supports detecting loss of hardware. Meaning that the
// driver detects in the course of its normal operation that there is a problem
// with the hardware that it manages. Ie the hardware has lost power, has been
// disconnected from the bus to which it was connected or has become defective.
// An asynchronous driver executes all of its functionality on a driver-specific
// dispatch queue. Note that the functionality may either execute synchronously
// or asynchronously from the viewpoint of the code that invoked the
// functionality.
// 
// Driver Model Summary:
//
// Synchronous:
//    - lives until system shutdown
//    - does not support Driver_Terminate()
//    - executes all functions in the context of the calling execution thread
//    - all functions are executed synchronously from the viewpoint of the caller
//
// Asynchronous:
//     - lives until Driver_Terminate() is called
//     - supports Driver_Terminate()
//     - executes all functions as work items on its own dispatch queue
//     - driver functions may execute synchronously or asynchronously from the
//       viewpoint of the caller
