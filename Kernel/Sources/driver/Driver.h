// A driver object manages a device. A device is a piece of hardware while a
// driver is the software that manages the hardware.
//
//
// -- The Driver Lifecycle --
//
// A driver has a lifecycle:
// - create: driver was just created
// - active: entered by calling Driver_Start()
// - terminating: entered by calling Driver_Terminate()
//
// A driver must be started by calling Driver_Start() before any other driver
// function is called. It is however possible to release a driver reference by
// calling Object_Release() even before Driver_Start() is called.
//
// The Driver_Start() function transitions the driver lifecycle state to active
// and it invokes the onStart() method. A driver subclass is expected to override
// onStart() to publish the driver to the driver catalog by calling
// Driver_Publish(). Additionally the driver subclass can do device specific
// initialization work in onStart(). A driver will only enter active state if
// the onStart() override returns with EOK.
//
// Once a driver has been started, driver channels may be created by calling
// Driver_Open() and a driver channel should be closed by calling
// IOChannel_Close() on the channel. IOChannel_Close() in turn invokes
// Driver_Close().
//
// A driver may be voluntarily terminated by calling Driver_Terminate(). This
// function must be called before the last reference to the driver is released
// by calling Object_Release(). Note however that Driver_Terminate() will only
// terminate the driver if there are no more channels open. It returns EBUSY as
// long as there is at least one channel still open.
//
// A typical driver lifecycle looks like this:
//
// Driver_Create()
//   Driver_Start()
//     Driver_Open()
//       IOChannel_Read()
//       ...
//     Driver_Close()
//   Driver_Terminate()
// Object_Release()
//
// Note that I/O channels are really used in connection with drivers to track
// when a driver is in use. A driver can not be terminated while it is still
// being used by someone (a channel is still open). Thus you must access a
// driver through a channel.
//
//
// -- Drivers, Concurrency and Exclusivity --
//
// I/O channel provides important preconditions for what is discussed below:
// *) All operations on an I/O channel are executed serially
// *) At most one operation can be active on an I/O channel at any given time
// *) It guarantees that no operation is active when it calls Driver_Close()
// *) It guarantees that as soon as Driver_Close() starts executing and at any
//    time after it returns, no new I/O operations will be issued to the driver
//
// The driver operations start(), open(), close() and terminate() are exclusive
// to each other in terms concurrency. This means that only one of those
// operations will execute at any given time. This ensures for example that
// start() has completed before open() can begin execution and that open() has
// completed before close() can begin execution.
//
// The fact that all driver I/O operations (read, write, ioctl) require that the
// caller passes in a I/O channel ensures that none of these operations can be
// executed before open() has completed and returned a valid I/O channel.
//
// The fact that I/O channel guarantees that all active I/O operations on the
// channel have completed before it invokes close() on the driver ensures that
// close() can assume that no I/O operations can be active that are related to
// the channel that is passed to close(). Thus it is not necessary for close()
// to take the same lock that is used to protect the integrity of the I/O
// operations.
//
// Note that onStart(), onStop(), onOpen() and onClose() are invoked while the
// driver is holding the driver state management lock. This should not be of
// much relevance to a driver subclass since a driver subclass has no need to
// acquire its I/O operations lock from these overrides. See the previous
// paragraph for an explanation of why this is the case.
//
// A driver subclass is expected to guarantee that its read, write and ioctl
// operations are properly synchronized with each other and that invoking these
// methods concurrently will not lead to inconsistent hardware nor software
// state.
//
// A driver can achieve this by eg protecting these methods with an I/O
// operation lock (mutex), by using a serial dispatch queue or by implementing
// its own specialized I/O operations queueing mechanism.
//
//
// -- The Children of a Driver --
//
// A driver may create and manage child drivers. Child drivers are attached to
// their parent drivers and the parent driver maintains a strong reference to
// its child driver(s). This strong reference keeps a child driver alive as long
// as it remains attached to its parent.
//
// Note that if a child driver needs to use its parent driver to do its job,
// the child driver should receive a driver channel and use it. This allows the
// parent driver to properly track whether it is still in use or not (see
// Terminate()).
// 
// The parent-child driver relationship can be used to properly represent
// relationships like a bus and the devices on the bus. The bus is represented
// by the parent driver and each device on the bus is represented by a child
// driver.
//
// Another use case for the parent-child driver relationship is that of a multi-
// function expansion board: an expansion board which features a sound chip and
// a CD-ROM driver can be represented by a parent driver that manages the overall
// card functionality plus a child driver for the sound chip and another child
// driver for the CD-ROM drive.
