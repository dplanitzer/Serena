// A driver object manages a device. A device is a piece of hardware while a
// driver is the software that manages the hardware.
//
// A driver has a lifecycle:
// - create: driver was just created
// - active: entered by calling Driver_Start()
// - terminating: entered by calling Driver_Terminate()
//
// A driver must be started by calling Driver_Start() before any other driver
// function is called. It is however possible to release a driver reference by
// calling Object_Release() even before Driver_Start() is called.
//
// The Driver_Start() function transitions the driver lifecycle state to active
// and it invokes the onStart() method. A driver subclass is expected to override
// onStart() to publish the driver to the driver catalog by calling
// Driver_Publish(). Additionally the driver subclass can do device specific
// initialization work in onStart(). A driver will only enter active state if
// the onStart() override returns with EOK.
//
// Once a driver has been started, driver channels may be created by calling
// Driver_Open() and a driver channel should be closed by calling
// IOChannel_Close() on the channel. IOChannel_Close() in turn invokes
// Driver_Close().
//
// A driver may be voluntarily terminated by calling Driver_Terminate(). This
// function must be called before the last reference to the driver is released
// by calling Object_Release(). Note however that Driver_Terminate() will only
// terminate the driver if there are no more channels open. It returns EBUSY as
// long as there is at least one channel still open.
//
// The Start(). Open(), Close() and Terminate() functions execute atomically
// with respect to each other. Ie an Open() call will not be interrupted by a
// Terminate() call.
//
// The driver Read(), Write() and Ioctl() functions are generically not expected
// to provide full atomicity since the driver channel class implements atomicity
// for those functions. However a driver subclass may have to implement some
// form of atomicity for read, write and ioctl to ensure that users using
// different driver channel at the same time can not inadvertently break the
// consistency of the hardware state.
//
// If a driver subclass introduces additional low-level functions that operate
// on a level below the driver channel and these functions are for consumption
// by other kernel components (ie DiskDriver.beginIO), then these functions must
// be protected by the driver lock (see Driver_Lock) to ensure that a
// termination can not happen in the middle of executing those low-level
// functions.
//
// A typical driver lifecycle looks like this:
//
// Driver_Create()
//   Driver_Start()
//     Driver_Open()
//       IOChannel_Read()
//       ...
//     Driver_Close()
//   Driver_Terminate()
// Object_Release()
//
// Note that I/O channels are really used in connection with drivers to track
// when a driver is in use. A driver can not be terminated while it is still
// being used by someone (a channel is still open). Thus you must access a
// driver through a channel.
//
// An important advantage of this design where a Terminate() is only possible
// after all channels have been closed, is that the read, write and ioctl
// driver functions do not need to use the driver lock. They can implement their
// own kind of locking if really needed and otherwise just rely on the locking
// provided by the driver channel.
//
// A driver may create and manage child drivers. Child drivers are attached to
// their parent drivers and the parent driver maintains a strong reference to
// its child driver(s). This strong reference keeps a child driver alive as long
// as it remains attached to its parent.
//
// Note that if a child driver needs to use its parent driver to do its job,
// the child driver should receive a driver channel and use it. This allows the
// parent driver to properly track whether it is still in use or not (see
// Terminate()).
// 
// The parent-child driver relationship can be used to properly represent
// relationships like a bus and the devices on the bus. The bus is represented
// by the parent driver and each device on the bus is represented by a child
// driver.
//
// Another use case for the parent-child driver relationship is that of a multi-
// function expansion board: an expansion board which features a sound chip and
// a CD-ROM driver can be represented by a parent driver that manages the overall
// card functionality plus a child driver for the sound chip and another child
// driver for the CD-ROM drive.
