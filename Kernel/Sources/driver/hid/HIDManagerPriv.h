// Explanation of logical keyboard/mouse device:
//
// The event driver maintains a logical keyboard and mouse device. These devices
// reflect the current state of the hardware as closely as possible and with as
// little latency as possible. So this state is maintained before the event queue.
// However these devices are logical in the sense that multiple hardware devices
// may contribute to their state. Eg multiple keyboards may contribute to the
// logical keyboard and multiple mice and other devices such as a joystick or
// light pen may contribute to the state of the logical mouse.
