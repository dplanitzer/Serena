// A disk driver manages the data stored on a disk. It provides read and write
// access to the disk data. Data on a disk is organized in blocks. All blocks
// are of the same size. Blocks are addressed with an index in the range
// [0, BlockCount). Note that a disk driver always implements the asynchronous
// driver model.
//
// A disk driver may either directly control a physical mass storage device or
// it may implement a logical mass storage device which delegates the actual data
// storage to another disk driver. To support the later use case, the DiskDriver
// class supports disk block address virtualization.
//
// The BeginIO() method receives the cached disk block that should be read or
// written plus a separate target address that indicates the physical disk block
// that should be read or written. A logical disk driver may map the target
// address that it has received to a new address suitable for another disk driver
// and it then invokes the beginIO() method with the new target address on this
// other driver.
//
// A disk driver may operate synchronously or queue-based. A synchronous disk
// driver is a driver where the BeginIO() method immediately processes the I/O
// request. The Begin() method of a queueing driver on the other hand simply
// adds the request to an internal queue. The requests on the queue are then
// asynchronously processed by the driver dispatch queue.
//
// A synchronous driver should override:
// - getMediaBlock()/putMediaBlock(), doIO() or beginIO()
//
// A queueing driver should override:
// - getMediaBlock()/putMediaBlock() or doIO()
//
// Logical block sizes vs media block sizes:
//
// Every disk driver defines a 'media block size' and 'media block count'. These
// are the size of a single block or sector on the media and the overall number
// of addressable sectors on the media. These numbers may change when the
// currently loaded media is ejected and replaced with a different media.
//
// Every disk driver is also associated with a disk cache. The disk cache defines
// a 'logical block size'. The logical block size is always a power-of-2 while
// the media block size is usually a power-of-2 but isn't required to be one.
// Eg CD-ROM Audio disks define a media block size of 2,352 bytes.
//
// A disk driver is required to call DiskDriver_NoteMediaLoaded() when a new
// media is loaded into the drive. This function takes a media info that
// describes the media block size and block count. The disk driver class then
// derives the logical block count and the conversation factor from media block
// size to logical block size. Note that the conversation is defined like this:
// * media block size is a power-of-2: as many media blocks are mapped to a
//                                     single logical block as possible.
// * media block size is NOT a power-of-2: a single media block is mapped to a
//                                         single logical block. The remaining
//                                         bytes are zero-filled on read and
//                                         ignored on write
//
// The disk driver implementation requires that:
// * logical block size is always a power-of-2
// * media block size may be a power-of-2
// * logical block size is always >= media block size
// * if media block size is not a power-of-2, then 1 logical block corresponds
//   to 1 media block
// 
// User space applications and kernel code which wants to invoke the raw read/
// write functions or access a disk through a FSContainer works with the logical
// block size. The media block size is only relevant to the internals of the disk
// driver. That said, the media block size and count are still made available as
// part of the DiskInfo object to enable user space code to show those values to
// the user if desired.
