// I/O channel ownership and operations tracking:
//
// I/O channels are reference counted objects. An I/O channel is created with one
// ownership reference active and a new ownership reference is established for a
// channel by calling IOChannel_Retain() on it. An ownership reference is released
// by calling IOChannel_Release(). Once the last ownership reference has been
// released and there are no ongoing I/O operations on the channel, and subject
// to the requirements of the I/O channel close mode (see below) the I/O channel
// is finalized. Finalizing an I/O channel means that it releases all its resources
// and that it may flush data that is still buffered up.
//
// Operations on an I/O channel are tracking with the IOChannel_BeginOperation()
// and IOChannel_EndOperation() calls. The former should be called before invoking
// one or more channel I/O operations and the latter one should be called at the
// end of a sequence of I/O operation calls.
//
// The IOChannelTable in a process takes care of the ownership of an I/O channel.
// It also offers the IOChannelTable_AcquireChannel() and
// IOChannelTable_RelinquishChannel() calls to take care of the I/O operation
// tracking.
//
// 
// Behavior of read, write, seek operations:
//
// I/O channels guarantee that these operations are serialized with respect to
// each other. This means that if you issue ie two concurrent write operations
// and both target the same byte range, that after the completion of each
// operation respective the byte range exclusively contains data provided by
// either operation and never a mix of data from both operations. This guarantee
// also includes that if you issue two overlapping concurrent operations that
// the one issued after the first one will start reading/writing at the file
// offset established by the completion of the previously issued operation.
//
//
// Behavior of the close() system call:
//
// The close() system call releases one ownership reference of an I/O channel
// and it removes the provided descriptor/ioc from the I/O channel table. The
// channel is scheduled for finalization once the last ownership reference (also
// meaning the last user visible descriptor/ioc) has been dropped.
// Close may flush buffered data to the I/O resource (ie disk). This write may
// fail with an error and close returns this error. However the close will still
// run to completion and close the I/O channel. The returned error is purely
// advisory and will not stop the close operation from closing the I/O channel.
//
//
// The three I/O channel close modes:
//
// 1) The close() system call removes an I/O channel ownership reference. If it
//    removes the last outstanding ownership reference then the I/O channel is
//    made invisible and the channel is scheduled for finalization. However the
//    actual finalization invocation is deferred until any still ongoing I/O
//    operations have completed. Once every ongoing I/O operation has completed
//    the channel is finalized.
//    (deferred close mode)
//
// 2) Similar to (1), however all ongoing I/O operations are canceled by the
//    last close() invocation and the I/O channel is finalized as soon as all
//    cancel operations have completed.
//    (canceling close mode)
//
// 3) Similar to (1) except that the last close() invocation is blocked until
//    all ongoing I/O operations have completed. Then the channel is finalized.
//    (blocking close mode)
//
// Only mode (1) is supported by the I/O channel class at this time. Support for
// the other modes is planned for the future.

    // means that the current file offset, channel open mode, etc is copied but
