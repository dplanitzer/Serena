// The purpose of the lock:
// 1) It ensures that if two or more concurrent reads/writes are issued for the
//    exact same byte range in the file, that once all reads/writes have finished
//    that all bytes are defined by the result of a single read/write operation.
//    Expressed differently, two writes to the same byte range will never result
//    in writing a mix of bytes from both writes. It's either all bytes from the
//    first or all bytes from the second write.
// 2) File offset changes are atomic.
// 3) It is permissible and safe to issue a close() on one thread of execution
//    while reads/writes are in progress on other threads of execution. The read
//    and write operations will correctly detect whether the channel is still
//    open or closed and proceed accordingly. Note that this means currently that
//    a close() does not cancel an ongoing operation. It has to wait until the
//    currently executing operation finishes.
