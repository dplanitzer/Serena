// running vcpu is running in user space and has a signal pending that requires
// urgent delivery. The sigurgent() system call itself does nothing but it gives
// the system call handler a chance to look at the pending signal and handle it
// as required.
// Note that we set up the sigurgent() injection in such a way that it can return
// back to user space and that the vcpu will be able to continue with whatever
// it was doing before the injection. We do this by pushing a RTS frame on the
// vcpu's user stack that will guide the vcpu back to the original point of
// interruption.
// Also note that we ensure that we do not try to inject a sigurgent while the
// vcpu is still executing inside an earlier sigurgent injection.
