// Dispatch Queues

extern DispatchQueueRef _Nonnull    gMainDispatchQueue;

// Creates a new dispatch queue. A dispatch queue maintains a list of work items
// and timers and it dispatches those things for execution to a pool of virtual
// processors. Virtual processors are automatically acquired and relinquished
// from the given virtual processor pool, as needed.
// A dispatch queue has a minimum, maximum and current concurrency. The minimum
// concurrency is currently always 0, while the maximum concurrency is the
// maximum number of virtual processors that the queue is allowed to acquire and
// maintain at any given time. The current concurrency is the number of virtual
// processors the queue is currently actively maintaining.
// A dispatch queue with a maximum concurrency number of 1 is also known as a
// serial dispatch queue because all work items and timers are dispatched one
// after the other. No two of them will ever execute in parallel on such a queue.
// A dispatch queue with a maximum concurrency of > 1 is also known as a concurrent
// queue because the queue is able to execute multiple work items and timers in
// parallel.
// The minimum concurrency level should typically be 0. The queue automatically
// acquires virtual processors as needed. However it may make sense to pass a
// number > 0 to this argument to ensure that the queue will always have at least
// this number of virtual processors available. Eg to ensure a certain minimum
// latency from when a work item is scheduled to when it executes.

// *) an abort of ongoing call-as-user operations on all VPs attached to the queue

// *) Marks the queue as terminated
// This function initiates the termination of the given dispatch queue. The
// termination process is asynchronous and does not block the caller. It only
// returns once the queue is in terminated state. Note that there is no guarantee

// will still execute or not. However there is a guarantee that once this function
