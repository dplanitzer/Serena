// The ZorroController is responsible for auto-configuring and managing the
// Zorro bus in your Amiga computer. There's exactly one instance of this driver
// in the system.
//
// The ZorroController enumerates all Zorro boards when the machine is powered
// up or reset. It assigns each board to an available address range and it
// creates an instance of the ZorroDriver class for each board. The ZorroDriver
// for a board then figures out which board specific driver should be used to
// control that board and it instantiates and starts this board driver.
//
// The board driver receives the ZorroDriver instance as its parent and it uses
// it to access the Zorro configuration information for the board.
//
// This design allows a board driver to derive from an arbitrary Driver subclass
// instead of forcing it to derive from a specific class, and thus it provides a
// lot more flexibility.
