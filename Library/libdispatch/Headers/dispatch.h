// A dispatcher or dispatch queue manages a FIFO queue of work items and
// dispatches those items to a set of virtual processors for execution. A
// serial dispatcher is a dispatcher that operates a single virtual processor
// while a concurrent dispatcher operates at least two virtual processors (and
// potentially many more than two).
//
// A dispatcher may have a fixed number of virtual processors associated with it
// or it may be configured such that it has the freedom to automatically
// relinquish and acquire virtual processors as needed.
//
// There are fundamentally two different ways to dispatch work to a dispatcher.
//
// Work may be dispatched asynchronously. This means that you create a work item
// and that you submit it to the dispatcher without indicating that the item
// should be awaitable. Submitting the item to the dispatcher transfers ownership
// of the item to the dispatcher. The dispatcher executes the item and then
// retires it by calling the retire function of the item once the item is done
// doing its work. There is no way to get back a result from a non-awaitable
// item. This is how you create and dispatch an asynchronous item:
//
// dispatch_item_t my_item = create_my_item(...);
//
// dispatch_submit(my_dispatcher, my_item);
//
// Work may be dispatched synchronously. This means that you create a work item
// mark it as awaitable, submit it, await it and then you retire it to free up
// all resources used by the item.
//
// Dispatching an item synchronously enables you to receive the result of the
// computation that the work item did. However you are fully responsible for
// managing the work item life time. The item will not be automatically retired
// by the dispatcher after the item is done. You have to do that yourself after
// you've awaited the item and retrieved its result.
//
// This is how you create and dispatch a synchronous item:
//
// dispatch_item_t my_item = create_my_item(...)
//
// my_item->flags |= DISPATCH_ITEM_AWAITABLE;
// dispatch_submit(my_dispatcher, my_item);
// ...
// dispatch_await(my_dispatcher, my_item);
// const int result = my_item->result;
// free_my_item(my_item);
//
// The nature of a work item
//
// A work item represents an invocation and as such observes value semantics.
// The function that is used to execute an item is a reference type - but the
// item itself is a value type. Thus a work item can not be submitted more than
// once and be associated with more than one dispatcher at the same time.
 

// The main dispatcher. This is a serial dispatcher that owns the main vcpu. The
// main dispatcher is started by calling dispatch_enter_main() from the main
// vcpu.

// The function responsible for implementing the work of an item.
typedef void (*dispatch_item_func_t)(struct dispatch_item* _Nonnull item);

// A function which knows how to retire an item that has finished processing or
// was cancelled. Providing this function is optional. The item will be
// deallocated by calling free() if no retire function is provided.
typedef void (*dispatch_retire_func_t)(struct dispatch_item* _Nonnull item);


// Marks an item as awaitable. This means that the item will produce a result
// and that you want to wait for the item to finish its run. You wait for an
// item to finish its execution by calling dispatch_await() on it. The call
// will block until the item has finished processing. It is then safe to
// access the item to retrieve its result.
#define DISPATCH_ITEM_AWAITABLE  1


// The state of an item. Items start out in idle state and transition to pending
// state when they are submitted to a dispatcher. An item transitions to execute
// state when a worker has dequeued it from the work queue. An item finally
// reaches done state after it has finished processing. An item reached the
// cancelled state after it has finished processing and the dispatcher has been
// terminated by calling dispatch_terminate(true).

// The base type of a dispatch item. Embed this structure in your item
// specialization (must be the first field in your structure). You are expected
// to set up the 'func' field and the 'flags' field. All other fields will be
// initialized properly by dispatch_submit().
//
// Note that a particular item instance can be queued at most once with a
// dispatcher. It is fine to re-submit it once it has completed execution but it
// can not be in pending or executing state more than once at the same time.
// Also note that an item may not be submitted to multiple dispatchers at the
// same time. The reasons are:
// serial queue: submitting the same item multiple times makes no sense since it
//               can only execute once at a time. Just execute it and then re-
//               submit.
// concurrent queue: items have state and having two or more vcpus execute the
//                   same item at the same time would make the state inconsistent.
