// A wait queue allows a set of vcpus to wait for something interesting to
// happen and for one or multiple vcpus to notify waiting vcpus that something
// interesting has happened. Waiting vcpus are put to sleep and they consume no
// real CPU time until they are woken up.

// descriptor on success and -1 on failure. Call destroy() to free the wait
// queue.

// unblocked signals are returned and cleared from the pending signal set. If
// 'mask' is NULL then the current signal mask is used. The original signal mask
